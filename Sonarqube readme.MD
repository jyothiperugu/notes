# CI/CD ---> We should something to observe the flow of the process.

# Scans :
	Shift-left ---> We will perform testing and scanning in early stage (DEV, SIT)
	
	Static source code analysis & static application security testing ---> SonarQube
	
# SonarQube :
			
			---> It is open-source platform for the continous inspection
			---> Code quality <---> Bugs, code smells, security vulnerabilities, code duplication across mutiple languages.
			
			* Key features : static analysis, quality gates, security hotspot detection, code coverage analysis
			
			---> On-premises or as a cloud-based solution.
			
		** How SonarQube works **
			---> Analysis
			---> Reporting
			---> Dashboard
			---> Resolution
			
		** Key Feature and capabilities **
			---> Static code analysis
			---> Security
			---> Code coverage
			---> Multi-languages support
			---> Quality gates
			
		*** In AWS we need to get SonarQube from Marketplace AMI ***
			
## Quality Gates :
			
			---> These are check points with in the software development life cycle
			
			** Key aspects of quality gates **
			
				---> Check points
				---> Pre-defined criteria
				---> Verification and Enforcement
				---> Automation
				
### Overall Code
			
			---> Issues === All detected problems
			---> Bugs === Runtime error
			---> Vulnerabilites === Exploitable weakness
			---> Code smells === Maintainability issues
			---> Maintainability Rating === Ease to maintaining code
			---> Security Rating === Safety from attacks
